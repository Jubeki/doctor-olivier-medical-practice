            1. About Olivier's Medical Practice

            Olivier's Medical Practice is an independent contractor providing primary medical services by way of a contract with NHS Lothian, made under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (the 1978 Act).

            2. About thepersonal information we use

            We use personal information on different groups of individuals including:

            - Patients
            - Staff
            - Contractors
            - Suppliers
            - Complainants, enquirers
            - Survey respondents
            - Professional experts and consultants

            The personal information we use includes information that identifies you like your name, address, date of birth and postcode.

            We also use more sensitive types of personal information, including information about racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union membership;genetic and biometric data,health; sex life or sexual orientation.

            The information we use can relate to personal and family details; education, training and employment details; financial details; lifestyle and social circumstances; goods and services; visual images; details held in thepatient record; responses to surveys.

            3. Our purposesfor using personal information

            Under the 1978 Act Olivier's Medical Practice and NHS Lothianhas the statutory responsibility to provide or arrange for the provision of a range of healthcare, health improvement and health protection services. We are given these tasks so that we can help to promote the improvement of the physical and mental health of the people of Olivier's Medical Practice and assist in operating a comprehensive and integrated national health service in Scotland.

            We usepersonal information to enable us to provide healthcare services for patients(including reminding you of appointments), data matching under the national fraud initiative; research; supporting and managing our employees; maintaining our accounts and records and the use of CCTV systems for crime prevention.

            4. Our legal basis for using personal information

            Olivier's Medical Practice, as data controller, is required to have a legal basis when using personal information. Olivier's Medical Practice considers that performance of our tasks and functions are in the public interest. So when using personal information our legal basis is usually that its use is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest,or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. In some situations we may rely on a different legal basis;for example,when we are using personal information to pay a supplier, our legal basis is that its use is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a buyer of goods and services. Another example would be for compliance with a legal obligation to which Olivier's Medical Practiceis subject to, for example under the Public Health etc (Scotland) Act 2008 we are required to notify Health Protection Scotland when someone contracts a specific disease.

            When we are usingmore sensitive types of personal information, including healthinformation,our legal basis is usually that the use is necessary:

            - for the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services
            - for reasons of public interest in the area of public health
            - for reasons of substantial public interest for aims that are proportionate and respect people’s rights, for example research
            - in order to protect the vital interests of an individual
            - for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or in the case of a court order
            
            On rare occasions we may rely on your explicit consent as our legal basis for using your personal information. When we do this we will explain what it means, and the rights that are available, to you.You should be aware that we will continue to ask for your consent for other things like taking part in a drug trial, or when you are having an operation.

            5. Who provides the personal information

            When you do not provide information directly to us, we receive it from other individuals and organisations involved in the delivery of health and care services in Scotland. These include other NHS Boards, NHS and as well as private hospitals and clinics, other primary care contractors such as other GPs, dentists, pharmacists and opticians; other public bodies e.g. Local Authorities and suppliers of goods and services
