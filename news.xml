            The Scottish Government provides the following Coronavirus advice:

            - wear a face covering
            - avoid crowded places
            - clean hands and surfaces regularly
            - stay 2m away from other people
            - self-isolate and book a test if you have COVID-19 symptoms
            
            All patients are requested to be aware of what you can and cannot do to suppress the virus by reading (information from the Scottish Government)[https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/] .

            Much useful information is also freely available (from the NHS)[https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19], which includes (Test and Protect)[https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/test-and-protect], the national scheme designed to stop the spread.
