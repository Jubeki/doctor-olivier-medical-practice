                    The personal information we use includes information that identifies you like your name, address, date of birth and postcode.<br><br>
                    
                    We also use more sensitive types of personal information, including information about racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical beliefs; trade union membership;genetic and biometric data,health; sex life or sexual orientation.<br><br>
                    
                    The information we use can relate to personal and family details; education, training and employment details; financial details; lifestyle and social circumstances; goods and services; visual images; details held in thepatient record; responses to surveys.<br><br>
                    
                    3. Our purposesfor using personal information<br><br>
                    
                    Under the 1978 Act Olivier's Medical Practice and NHS Lothianhas the statutory responsibility to provide or arrange for the provision of a range of healthcare, health improvement and health protection services. We are given these tasks so that we can help to promote the improvement of the physical and mental health of the people of Olivier's Medical Practice and assist in operating a comprehensive and integrated national health service in Scotland.<br><br>
                    
                    We usepersonal information to enable us to provide healthcare services for patients(including reminding you of appointments), data matching under the national fraud initiative; research; supporting and managing our employees; maintaining our accounts and records and the use of CCTV systems for crime prevention.<br><br>
                    
                    4. Our legal basis for using personal information<br><br>
                    
                    Olivier's Medical Practice, as data controller, is required to have a legal basis when using personal information. Olivier's Medical Practice considers that performance of our tasks and functions are in the public interest. So when using personal information our legal basis is usually that its use is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest,or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. In some situations we may rely on a different legal basis;for example,when we are using personal information to pay a supplier, our legal basis is that its use is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a buyer of goods and services. Another example would be for compliance with a legal obligation to which Olivier's Medical Practiceis subject to, for example under the Public Health etc (Scotland) Act 2008 we are required to notify Health Protection Scotland when someone contracts a specific disease.<br><br>
                    
                    When we are usingmore sensitive types of personal information, including healthinformation,our legal basis is usually that the use is necessary:<br><br>

                                <li>for reasons of public interest in the area of public health</li>
                                <li>for reasons of substantial public interest for aims that are proportionate and respect people’s rights, for example research</li>
