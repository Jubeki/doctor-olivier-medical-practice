For an introduction, we'd like to display the following quote found at https://www.hausarztberlin.de:
> The old doctor speaks Latin, the young doctor speaks German,
> but the good doctor speaks the language of his patients!

The following texts and images should then be used to introduce our small team:

> It is only thanks to the good cooperation in our practice team that we can take care of you - our patients - intensively. Our employees are all qualified, trained professionals who are always very committed to helping patients.
> 
> The certificates issued for voluntary further training measures are an expression of the regular training activities. By actively participating in these further training measures, we not only ensure the quality of medical care for our patients, but are also up to date with the latest medical knowledge. This means that our patients can be sure that they will be advised and treated based on the latest findings.
