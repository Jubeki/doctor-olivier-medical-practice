Prescriptions for ongoing medications may be requested online via AskMyGP, as shown in the column on the right. Please allow a minimum of 2 working days before collection. If you are making your request outwith surgery hours, please note that this will not be received until the next working day.

If you have run out of your repeat medications, and have not already put in a repeat request, you must attend to see the Doctor.

Repeat medication will not be issued by a GP making house calls or during a surgery based consultation (unless you are specifically attending for repeat medication and have completely run out).

Or you can order here:
