The "Contact Us" page should allow patients and those interested in registering with our practice to find out how to get in touch with us. It should show the opening hours, address, an online contact-formular (the contents of which will be sent to us by E-Mail if submitted; our back-end provider will take care of this, for now you can concentrate on just the design), and a number to contact us outside of the office hours. It could have the following structure and content:


> Address: Ross Gardens 43, Edinburgh, EH9 3BP  
> Email: team@doctor-olivier.uk  
> Phone: +44 131 229 0000

It should be possible to click our AskMyGP link (https://my.askmygp.uk/?c=S71379) from somewhere within the last paragraph, or a corresponding image / box. A corresponding image / box could be, for instance:

Finally, the online contact formular should include the following fields, so we can keep up correspondence with patients writing to us this way:
- Name
- Email
- Phone (Optional)
- Subject
