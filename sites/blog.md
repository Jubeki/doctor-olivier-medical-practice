| title    | Health with Dr. Olivier / BLOG ENTRY TITLE |
---------------------------------------------------------

Since Dr. Olivier lives for his trade and likes to write in his free time, he'd like to have a blog where he can inform patients and interested viewers about health best practices and current news in his field. This page should show a list of blog entries he made in chronological order with a short introduction, each of which is given by an XML file (see the given example [blog.xml](../blog.xml) and the corresponding dtd file). The individual pages of the blog are named along the scheme "blog-POSTNAME.html", where POSTNAME is derived from the title of the blog. The individual pages are linked to from this main page.
