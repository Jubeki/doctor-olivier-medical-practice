                        WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Coronavirus (COVID-19)<br><br>
                        
                        Coronaviruses (CoV) are a group of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.<br><br>
                        
                        COVID-19 (coronavirus) is a novel coronavirus which hasn’t been previously identified in humans. It can affect your lungs and airways. There have been tens of thousands of coronavirus cases reported in the UK.<br><br>
                        
                        Fast facts<br><br>
                        
                        Should I be worried about the coronavirus?<br><br>
                        
                        You may feel some anxiety and stress about COVID-19 due to news reporting on the outbreak. It’s important to stay calm and follow official advice to protect yourself from getting infected. You can stay up to date with the latest information about COVID-19 on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus">GOV.UK website</a>.<br><br>
                        
                        How did the coronavirus start?<br><br>
                        
                        COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, where the first case was reported in late December, 2019. The spread of the virus increased quickly and reached other countries due to international travel. Public health officials around the world have put in measures to fight the spread of the virus.<br><br>
                        
                        How will the coronavirus impact my travel?<br><br>
                        
                        As of 23rd March, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises British people travelling abroad to return to the UK now, if commercial flights are still available. If you are travelling abroad, you should contact your airline or travel company and keep up-to-date with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">official government travel advice</a>. The FCO advises against all non-essential travel worldwide. This advice took effect on 17th March and applies for 30 days.<br><br>
